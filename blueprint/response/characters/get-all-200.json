        "description":"Jet, known on his home satellite as the \"Black Dog\" for his tenacity, is a 36-year-old former cop from Ganymede (a Jovian satellite) and acts as Spike's foil during the series. Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).<br/><br/>Jet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).<br/><br/>During the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover.<br/><br/><span class=\"spoiler\">In a later episode, another Vicious/Spike parallel is set up when Jet finds out that it was his old partner Fad who betrayed him (though in Jet's case, there was no love affair involved). Fad arranged for Jet's death in a setup, but he survived with only a missing arm and a scar on his face. It is worth noting that Jet managed to face the demons of his past and let them go, in contrast to Spike, who was killed when he confronted his. This is likely due to the contrast in the two approaches to the past. While Spike hid and fled from his past, Jet tracked it down and confronted it.</span>",

        "description":"Height: 185 cm (6' 1\")<br/>Weight: 70 kg (155 lbs)<br/>Blood type: O<br/>Date of Birth: June 26, 2044<br/>Planet of Origin: Mars<br/><br/>Spike Spiegel is a tall and lean 27-year-old bounty hunter born on Mars. The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs.",

        "name":"Faye Valentine",
        "malId":2,
        "description":"Faye Valentine<br/>Birthday: August 14, 1994<br/><br/>One of the members of the bounty hunting crew in the anime series Cowboy Bebop. Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.<br/><br/>Seemingly little more than a thorn in her partnersâ€™ sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support. She brags and takes care of herself, never trusting others, cheating and lying her way from one day to the next.<br/><br/>She is a woman who is skilled at getting what she wants; however, her indomitable exterior hides a more delicate interior. Upon awakening from her 54-year cryogenic sleep, not only was she saddled with a massive amount of debt that she had no means to pay, but she was also diagnosed with total amnesia, a stranger in a mysterious world that she was not a part of and did not understand, surrounded by people who claimed to be helping her but were only there to take advantage of her naivetÃ©. The surname \"Valentine\" was merely a name given to her by the doctor who woke her; the circumstances of her accident, her previous life, and even her real name all remain a mystery, and are only gradually revealed as the series progresses. It has been hinted that she came from Singapore on Earth, and was the daughter of a very wealthy family, as the city's famous Merlion Statue features prominently in scenes of her childhood, and that memories and a film from her childhood showed her living in a large mansion. In an early episode, she states that she is descended from Roma people, but she may well have been lying. Utterly betrayed by someone she thought she could trust after waking, Faye found herself burdened with even more money to pay, and the situation resulted in the hardening of her personality to an extreme degree. She even says in Session 11: â€œwe deceive or we are deceivedâ€�, and that â€œnothing good ever happened to me when I trusted others.â€�<br/><br/>Throughout the series, though she retains her sarcastic demeanor and unpleasant nature up until the very end, it is easy to see her grow as a character. She learns to value her comrades, coming back to the Bebop when she realizes that it is the only home that she has left, naming it as the â€œonly place I could return toâ€�. She grows to understand the disadvantages of being a loner, and that even though her \"family\" is somewhat dysfunctional it is still a place where she will always belong.<br/><br/>",

        "description":"The self-invented personal name of an elite net-diver from Earth, hacker \"Radical Edward\" is a very strange, somewhat androgynous, teenage girl assumed to be around 13 years in age. She has a feral aspect reflected in her mannerisms, bare feet, strange postures and gangling walk.<br/><br/>Ed could be considered a \"free spirit\"; she is fond of silly exclamations and childish rhymes, easily distracted, and the show's primary source of physical humor.<br/><br/>Over the course of the show she rarely walks anywhere, preferring to run, crawl, flip, roll, walk on her hands, or even just saunter. Ed is always barefoot. In one episode, she considers putting on socks and shoes, but quickly removes them, as even wearing socks hampers her, and she falls over seconds after putting them on; she also appears to be exceptionally strong and flexible, being able to support her weight on her arms for several minutes at a time, and to scratch her nose with her toe.<br/><br/>In the English version, she almost always refers to herself in the third person.<br/><br/>Not much is known about her origins, only that she spent some of her earlier childhood in an orphanage after being left there by her father, a man named Afedersiniz Hesap Lütfen (he calls Ed \"Françoise\", and may be of Turkish origin as his name means \"excuse me, check please\" in Turkish). In the manga it is revealed that she was a friend of a timid young boy in the orphanage known simply as \"Tomato\" (which also happens to be the brand name scrawled in katakana on her PC) who, like Ed, knew a great deal about computers and the net, and it is probably safe to assume that his friendship with Ed helped turn her into the genius-hacker she is today.<br/><br/>Ed's primary use to the Bebop crew is as a hacker; she is widely known to be a whiz kid behind a computer. Ed's computer of choice is a carry-along Tomato desktop, an homage to the portable flatpanel-outfitted Apple IIc from the 80s, and when traveling by foot she will balance it on her head.<br/><br/>Ed has a strong rapport with Jet, who acts as a surrogate father, and Faye, who acts as something of a big sister (much to Faye's chagrin). Ed also seems to be the only person who can understand Ein (though in a few instances Jet could understand Ein also).",

        "description":"Ein is a Pembroke Welsh Corgi brought aboard the Bebop by Spike after a failed attempt to capture a bounty. Ein is a \"data dog\": while the televised series only briefly hints on the fact that this means Ein's brain was somehow enhanced drastically, the manga shows Ed accessing data stored in Ein's brain via a virtual reality-type interface with which she has a conversation with a human proprietor. It is obvious that Ein is abnormally intelligent, as he is able to answer the telephone, drive a car (just the wheel), use the SSW, play shÅ�gi, and generally do a number of other things that an average canine should not be able to do, but he never talks in a human language during the show. He does, however, speak in Session 18 \"Speak Like A Child\" after the credits Ein tells Spike \"Next Episode: Wild Horses\". He is able to \"speak\" to other species, as demonstrated in Session 17, \"Mushroom Samba\" (he spoke to a cow with a subtitled bark of \"Thanks\", to which the cow has a subtitled moo back of \"No problem\"). It is likely that Ed is the only crew member with any idea of Ein's capabilities, as the other crew members are quick to dismiss Ein, and never seem to acknowledge him as more than a pet. Ein initially takes a shine to Jet, but when Ed joins the crew, he comes around to her as well. Frequently the two trade roles, with Ein expressing very human sentiments via facial expression and Ed regressing to a feral state. He went with Ed after she left the crew, probably because of his attachment to her. His name is a pun on the Japanese word for \"dog\" (çŠ¬ inu) but is also German for \"one\". \"Ein\" may also be short for \"Einstein\", after Albert Einstein, because of the extraordinary intelligence he possesses.",

She quickly follows Ed on a chase for a mushroom farmer that harvests rare drug-like mushrooms. Coffee gets into her convertible car and chases after the train. Ed and the dealer hop on and she tries to stop a fellow bounty hunter from catching them first. She ends up stopping him, but he falls on her, causing both of them to crash and lose the bounty.",
